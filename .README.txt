    CAIDA Public Macroscopic Topology Data Archive
    From The Archipelago Measurement Infrastructure
=======================================================

This public dataset contains all IPv4 measurements from Archipelago (Ark) that are
older than approximately two years, and all IPv6 measurements (upto the present).

The most recent two years of IPv4 data are only available as a restricted dataset.
This applies to the following four datasets:

./ipv4/probe-data    contains the raw IPv4 team-probing data
                     http://www.caida.org/data/active/ipv4_routed_24_topology_dataset.xml
./ipv4/dns-names     contains fully-qualified domain names for IP addresses in the team-probing data
./ipv4/dns-traffic   contains quarterly samples of the DNS query and response traffic resulting
                     from the DNS lookups
                     http://www.caida.org/data/active/ipv4_dnsnames_dataset.xml
./ipv4/itdk          contains macroscopic internet topology data kits based on the Ark IPv4 measurements
                     http://www.caida.org/data/internet-topology-data-kit/

For the remaining datasets all data (up to the present) are available:

./ipv4/as-links      contains AS links observed in Ark IPv4 measurements
                     http://www.caida.org/data/active/ipv4_routed_topology_aslinks_dataset.xml
./ipv6/probe-data    contains the raw IPv6 probing data
                     http://www.caida.org/data/active/ipv6_allpref_topology_dataset.xml
./ipv6/as-links      contains AS links observed in Ark IPv6 measurements
                     http://www.caida.org/data/active/ipv6_aslinks_dataset.xml
./ipv6/dns-names     contains fully-qualified domain names for IPv6 addresses in the probe data
